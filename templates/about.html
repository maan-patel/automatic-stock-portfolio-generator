  <p>Why are women not trading? <br> In total, there are 13. 9 million online traders in 2018. Yet globally, only 1 in 7 online traders are women. If you profile a typical U.S. and U.K. trader, the only similarities between the two profiles are that they are both male traders. <br><br> The founder and CEO of ARK, one of the most successful fund management companies focusing on investing in disruptive technologies, is Catherine Wood, a Wall Street Veteran with 20 years of experience (Source: ARK, 2021). ARK now manages $52.85 billion worth of assets, among them $45.27 billion are ETF. The best performing ETF â€” ARK Genomic Revolution ETF realized 178.28% of return in 2020 (ETF.com, 2021). According to the research by Vanguard (Financial Times, 2020), when the stock market crashed in late Feb to March 2020 because of COVID, women trade less but have better returns than men. <br><br> The study also suggested women are more tolerant of risk during the volatility and are less likely to overact. It can be explained by the fact that men are over confident in male dominated areas such as finance. Finance, is a traditionally male dominated industry. <br><br>  Without knowledge, proper training, it is risky to embark into the stock market. Many women working in informal sectors do not have a bank account, let alone a stock trading account. We, as a team, proposes to build an intuition-based stock trading software with automatic portfolio recommendation features</p>
