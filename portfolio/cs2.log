function eai_api_call(('Tech Companies That Made #BlackLivesMatter Pledges Have Fewer Black Employees. (Bloomberg) -- After the murder of George Floyd last year prompted widespread protests, dozens of companies released public pledges to promote racial justice. However, their support of the Black community wasn’t reflected in the demographics of their workforces.A new study of diversity in the technology industry found companies that made statements of solidarity had 20% fewer Black employees on average than those that didn’t. The finding highlights a gap between what companies say about social issues and what they do in their own workplaces, said Stephanie Lampkin, the founder and chief executive officer of Blendoor, which conducted the study set to be published Monday.Blendoor, a startup that helps companies recruit a diverse group of candidates, crunched publicly available data on 240 of the most prominent tech companies. Despite the shortcomings of many companies that put out Black Lives Matter statements, the pledges could have a serious impact. Their financial commitments surpassed $4.6 billion, more than double the amount of pledges made in the previous six years combined, according to the report.Read more: New Data Expose Precisely How White and Male Some U.S. Companies AreReviewing information released by companies over the past six years, Blendoor analyzed trends in workplace diversity, inclusion policies and human-resources programs, such as parental leave, flexible work arrangements and recruitment of underrepresented groups. It found, for example, that Pinterest Inc. had the most robust policies and programs for recruiting women; Mozilla Corp. had the best for recruiting underrepresented minorities. McKesson Corp. scored highest in Blendoor’s rating of supporting women in leadership, while HP Inc. tops the list for underrepresented minorities in leadership.The analysis surfaced broader findings, as well, across hundreds of companies. Asian Americans have the widest gap between their representation in entry-level tech jobs and in leadership, and Asian-American women are the least likely to advance to executive roles. Women executives more commonly have C-level jobs that focus on areas such as HR, marketing or diversity, and those roles are among the least likely to be appointed to corporate boards. The analysis also found that 36% of board directors are women or people of color but that most of those are White women or Asian men.Lampkin, who started coding as a teenager and holds degrees from Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has spent years trying to find the right technological tools to bolster diversity efforts. She founded Blendoor in 2015 as a mobile job-matching app—swiping left and right on candidates. Then, as more employers became interested in preventing unconscious bias in hiring, the app started presenting candidates in a blind setting, without pictures or names. In 2017, Blendoor started rating companies’ overall diversity efforts, using similar methodology to the latest report.Outside of her company, Lampkin also runs a network for Black women in tech, called Visible Figures, where members trade funding, press advice, recommendations and connections. Lampkin said she’s optimistic about the push for diversity in tech given the rate of change in the last few decades but that the industry is a long way from parity. “We need all hands on deck if this is really going to change,” Lampkin said. “It has to be a paradigm shift that I don’t think is happening yet. Right now, I think it’s a lot of preaching to choirs.”More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',), {'client': <expertai.nlapi.cloud.client.ExpertAiClient object at 0x7f46556c07c0>})  took 1134457271 ns.

Cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets totaled $2,907.4 million on March 31, 2021, compared to $1,996.5 million on December 31, 2020. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets resulted primarily from (i) the closing of a global offering, which resulted in the receipt of $1,092.1 million in net proceeds in February 2021, (ii) the net receipt of a $73.1 million non-creditable, non-refundable development cost-sharing payment in the form of newly issued Zai Lab shares received as part of the strategic collaboration for efgartigimod in Greater China, partially offset by (iii) the payment of $98.0 million related to the purchase of a priority review voucher from Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals and other net cash flows used in operating activities. Total operating income increased by $141.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $167.4 million, compared to $25.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the closing of the strategic collaboration for efgartigimod with Zai Lab, resulting in the recognition of $151.9 million in collaboration revenue. Research and development expenses increased by $17.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 to $122.3 million, compared to $104.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in the first three months of 2021 resulted primarily from higher external research and development expenses, mainly related to the efgartigimod program in multiple indications and other clinical and preclinical programs. Furthermore, the research and development personnel expenses increased due to a planned increase in headcount and the increased costs of the share-based payment compensation plans related to the grant of stock options. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $56.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to $27.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

The increase in cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets resulted primarily from the closing of a global offering in May 2020, including a U.S. offering and a European private placement, which resulted in the receipt of €778.1 million in gross proceeds, decreased by €47.4 million of underwriter discounts and commissions, and offering expenses, partially offset by net cash flows used in operating activities. Revenue decreased by €33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €36.4 million, compared to €69.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the milestone payments following the first-in-human clinical trial with ABBV-151 under the AbbVie collaboration which was achieved in the year ended December 31, 2019, partly offset by revenue recognition of the transaction price related to the Janssen collaboration. The increase in other income is primarily driven by increased research and development incentives and higher payroll tax rebates for employing certain highly qualified research and development personnel. Research and development expenses increased by €127.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to €325.5 million, compared to €197.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase resulted primarily from higher external research and development expenses, primarily related to the efgartigimod program in various indications, cusatuzumab program and other clinical and preclinical programs. Furthermore, the personnel expenses increased due to a planned increase in headcount. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled €149.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to €64.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Regulated Information/Inside Information argenx Announces FDA Acceptance of BLA Filing for Efgartigimod for the Treatment of Generalized Myasthenia Gravis If approved, efgartigimod will be the first-and-only approval of an FcRn antagonistPrescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is December 17, 2021Pre-approval access program opened in U.S. for efgartigimod for eligible people living with gMG Breda, the Netherlands – March 2, 2021 – argenx (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX), a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases and cancers, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for intravenous (IV) efgartigimod, the company’s investigational FcRn antagonist and lead product candidate, for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). The FDA has set a standard 10-month review process with a PDUFA target action date of December 17, 2021. “This is an important milestone for argenx in our transition to a commercial-stage company and brings us closer to our mission to reach patients living with gMG, a debilitating neuromuscular disease,” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren, Chief Executive Officer of argenx. “We look forward to closely collaborating with the FDA through the BLA review process and to potentially making our first medicine available.” The BLA included results from the pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod for the treatment of patients with gMG. ADAPT met its primary endpoint defined as percentage of responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score among acetylcholine receptor-antibody positive (AChR-Ab+) gMG patients. 67.7% of AChR-Ab+ patients treated with efgartigimod achieved the primary endpoint compared with 29.7% on placebo (p<0.0001). Further, 40% of patients treated with efgartigimod achieved minimal symptom expression defined as MG-ADL scores of 0 (symptom free) or 1, compared to 11.1% of those who received placebo. The safety profile of efgartigimod was comparable to placebo. After completing ADAPT, 90% of participants entered ADAPT+, a three-year open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of efgartigimod. There are currently 118 patients still enrolled in ADAPT+. argenx also announced today the opening of its pre-approval access (PAA) program in the U.S., which will allow eligible people living with gMG to receive treatment with efgartigimod. The purpose of the PAA is to open availability of an investigational treatment to people who have a high degree of unmet clinical need with gMG and are not able to participate in a clinical trial. argenx is also on track to submit an application for efgartigimod to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in the first half of 2021 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the second half of 2021. About Efgartigimod Efgartigimod is an investigational antibody fragment designed to reduce disease-causing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and block the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is widely expressed throughout the body and plays a central role in rescuing IgG antibodies from degradation. Blocking FcRn reduces IgG antibody levels representing a logical potential therapeutic approach for several autoimmune diseases known to be driven by disease-causing IgG antibodies, including: myasthenia gravis (MG), a chronic disease that causes muscle weakness; pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a chronic disease characterized by severe blistering of the skin; immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a chronic bruising and bleeding disease; and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a neurological disease leading to impaired motor function. About Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease, often causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. More than 85% of people with MG progress to generalized MG (gMG) within 18 months, where muscles throughout the body may be affected, resulting in extreme fatigue and difficulties with facial expression, speech, swallowing and mobility. In more life-threatening cases, MG can affect the muscles responsible for breathing. There are approximately 65,000 people in the United States and 20,000 people in Japan living with the disease About argenx argenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases and cancer.

function eai_api_call(('Argentina’s Central Bank Move Raises Inflation Concerns. (Bloomberg) -- A measure allowing Argentina’s commercial banks to move part of their reserve requirements from central bank notes to treasury bonds is raising concerns about inflation and the financial system’s health.The country’s central bank said late Thursday that the move is intended to boost liquidity in the local, treasury debt market. The option is voluntary: banks aren’t obliged to buy the treasury notes, which are considered riskier, longer-term assets compared to the very short-term central bank debt.An official at the monetary authority said the change wouldn’t put the banks at risk because liquidity requirements remain in place and not all of the central bank’s 7-day notes can be converted into treasury bonds, only a portion.The policy move would not have an impact on the credit quality of Argentine financial entities in the short term, according to a statement issued Friday by Moody’s Local Argentina, a domestic credit ratings platform that’s part of Moody’s Corporation.Still, analysts warn that the measure risks stoking inflation by financing more government spending and exposing commercial banks to a government infamous for being a serial defaulter. Consumer prices are up 46% from a year ago, and Argentines’ inflation expectations have hit a record.“This measure is going to be reflected in higher inflation eventually, because monetarily it’s expansive,” said Marcos Buscaglia, founder of consulting firm Alberdi Partners in Buenos Aires.Former policy makers evoked memories of Argentina’s 2001 banking crisis, when a government default triggered a domino effect in the financial sector because its institutions held an excessive amount of treasury notes.“The central bank today announced a measure that puts at risk one of the few important consensuses that economic policy had achieved: Prudent regulation of the banking system,” Guido Sandleris, the central bank chief until late 2019 under the previous government, tweeted on Thursday. Breaking from that consensus “to marginally reduce the government’s financing costs is a bad sign.”Read more: In Argentina, March Activity Drop Still Allows for 1Q GrowthTreasury notes today offer a premium of between 200 and 300 basis points higher than central bank notes. For banks, the trade-off is taking greater risk and investing the money over periods of 180 days or more, while the central bank offers 7-day notes.The decision comes as Argentine officials need to finance more Covid-19 social spending that wasn’t anticipated, as a record wave of cases has triggered another severe lockdown. Analysts have also warned in recent weeks about decreasing rollover rates of treasury debt auctions.Read more: Argentina Inflation Rose Faster Than Expected Again in April The central bank official said banks could use up to 800 billion pesos ($8.5 billion dollars) -- equivalent to 32% of the monetary base -- of the reserve requirements that they have invested today in Leliq, central bank notes, to buy Treasury securities. Holdings of the Leliq notes total 2 trillion pesos and have nearly doubled since early 2020.Analysts warn that if commercial banks shift their reserve requirements from the central bank to treasury bonds, it may not count toward the legal limit of exposure they can have toward government debt.“Banks remain much more exposed to the public sector,” said Fausto Spotorno, director of economic research at consulting firm Orlando J. Ferreres y Asociados. “A certain risk exists that in the case of a run on peso deposits, you’d have a debt problem, or conversely, in the case of a debt default in pesos, you’d have a problem with deposits.”(Updates with statement from Moody’s Local Argentina)More stories like this are available on bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',), {'client': <expertai.nlapi.cloud.client.ExpertAiClient object at 0x7f46556c07c0>})  took 1082398352 ns.

(Bloomberg) -- Oil posted its biggest weekly gain since the middle of April ahead of the U.S. Memorial Day weekend that kicks off the country’s summer driving season.West Texas Intermediate rose 4.3% this week. A spate of positive U.S. economic data this week continued to highlight the recovery taking shape in the world’s largest oil-consuming country, while Americans are expected to unleash demand built up during the pandemic from this weekend onward.With more drivers taking to the road and with some of the lowest gasoline stockpiles in almost 30 years, some see the U.S. facing a supply squeeze on par with those seen when a hurricane knocks out oil refineries in Texas and Louisiana.“The demand outlook appears very robust, especially in the U.S., and it’s really improving in Europe as well,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. “There’s optimism that the advanced economies are going to have Covid in the reaview mirror by the end of the summer.”Still, futures declined on Friday, snapping a five-day winning streak, as prices have remained stuck in a $10 range since March. Supply concerns remain over international talks to revive the Iran nuclear accord, which could pave the way for more oil flowing from the country. At the same time, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies meet next week, with delegates saying the alliance looks set to rubberstamp oil-output increases.“The most immediate risk to the upside would be an agreement at the nuclear talks between world powers and Iran in Vienna,” Bob Yawger, head of the futures division at Mizuho Securities, said in a note. “Nobody wants to get caught long over the weekend and see an agreement get done.”Ministers from the OPEC+ alliance are set to meet on June 1 to assess the global market and their production policy. All but four of 24 analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg predict they’ll ratify an 840,000-barrel-a-day increase scheduled for July, completing a three-part process to revive just over 2 million barrels this summer.The market’s positive outlook is reflected in WTI’s longer-term spreads. The price of the U.S. benchmark for December 2021 was $4.75 a barrel higher than futures for the same month in 2022.

(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. sold bonds to refinance debt and buy back stock, as cheap borrowing costs prove too tempting to resist even for a company with tens of billions of dollars in cash.The online retail giant issued $18.5 billion of debt in eight parts. The longest portion, a 40-year security, yields 95 basis points over Treasuries, after initial price talk at around 115 basis points, said the people, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private.Companies have been taking advantage of wide-open bond markets and spreads at three-year lows to score cheap borrowing, even if they don’t need it. With the economy rebounding from the pandemic, U.S. investment-grade firms are increasingly tempted to spend their cash cushions on acquisitions and dividend hikes, or borrow even more.Read more: Corporate Cash Grab Flashes Warning for Bonds: Lisa AbramowiczAt $18.5 billion, it’s Amazon’s biggest bond sale ever, and the second-largest this year behind Verizon Communication Inc.’s $25 billion offering in March. The company was said to originally be targeting $15 billion earlier Monday.Amazon is coming off of a record earnings quarter and it provided a sales forecast for the current period that was stronger than analysts’ estimates. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities stood at $73 billion at the end of March, near an all-time high.“They can grow into this leverage,” Matt Brill, head of North America investment grade at Invesco Ltd., said on Bloomberg TV Monday. “If you’re able to borrow for reasonably cheap, and then you’re able to get the operating leverage to go with it, it results in a lot of earnings.”A representative for Amazon did not respond to requests for comment.What Bloomberg Intelligence Says“The size of Amazon.com’s balance sheet may grow meaningfully as its weighted-average-cost of debt capital hovers near zero. With abundant cash and growing free cash flow, borrowing may not be needed. Yet the ability to fund organic growth and potentially initiate a large shareholder-return program at historically low costs suggests additional debt over time.”-- Robert Schiffman, senior credit analyst. Click here to read the researchAmazon has been a fairly infrequent issuer, but it comes in big on those rare occasions. It last tapped the bond market in June 2020, borrowing $10 billion for general corporate purposes. Prior to that, it sold $16 billion of bonds in 2017 to help finance its acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc.The proceeds of Monday’s offering will be for general corporate purposes, which may also include acquisitions and working capital. The two-year bond will be allocated for eligible green or social projects, which may include clean transportation, renewable energy and sustainable buildings, according to bond documents.Moody’s Investors Service upgraded Amazon one notch to A1, its fifth-highest investment-grade rating, with a stable outlook. While the new debt sale temporarily increases leverage, proceeds are expected to be deployed over time for capital expenditures that fuel growth, which is a long-term positive for the credit, said Moody’s analyst Charles O’Shea.Amazon has been on a spending spree since the pandemic began, building new warehouses and cloud-computing data centers across the world to meet surging demand from online shoppers and businesses turning to remote work. Purchases of property and equipment totaled $45 billion in the 12 months ended in March, up from $20 billion during the prior period.The company’s board of directors authorized $5 billion in share buybacks in 2016, but it has never made purchases under that authority.Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo & Co. managed the sale.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.',), {'client': <expertai.nlapi.cloud.client.ExpertAiClient object at 0x7f46556c07c0>})  took 1136386927 ns.

Incyte Corporation (NASDAQ: INCY) has announced positive topline results from its pivotal Phase 3 TRuE-V trial program evaluating ruxolitinib cream in adolescent and adult patients (age ≥12 years) with vitiligo, a skin condition defined by the loss of pigment cells. Phase 3 trials of ruxolitinib cream have met their primary endpoints. The success of the topical JAK inhibitor tees Incyte up to seek approval in the U.S. and Europe in the second half of the year. Incyte said ruxolitinib beat placebo in terms of the proportion of patients whose facial vitiligo improved by 75% or more at Week 24. Details of how many patients met the F-VASI75 vitiligo score criteria remain under wraps, but Incyte said the overall efficacy and safety profile is consistent with its phase 2 results. In the earlier trial, 21% of patients who used the phase 3 dose—ruxolitinib cream 1.5% twice daily, experienced a 75% improvement by Week 24. The F-VASI75 rate rose to 66% by Week 104, although the figure comes from a smaller cohort as 41% of people were lost to follow-up. F-VASI75 at Week 52 was 37%. No new safety signals were observed.

(NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today announced positive 12-week expression and safety results from the first 11 participants enrolled in Study SRP-9001-103, an open-label study known as ENDEAVOR being conducted in partnership with Roche. In results from the first clinical study using commercially representative material, SRP-9001 (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin) demonstrated robust expression of micro-dystrophin and no new safety signals from prior studies, supporting its potentially differentiated profile for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver its micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein. “We are delighted by these seminal results from the ENDEAVOR Study, our first trial results with SRP-9001 made by our commercial-scale manufacturing process. These data show strong transduction of the micro-dystrophin gene, resulting in robust expression of the properly localized micro-dystrophin protein, and did so with no new or unexpected safety signals,” said Doug Ingram, president and chief executive officer, Sarepta. “In addition to characterizing and differentiating SRP-9001, these results confirm the extraordinary work done over the last two and a half years to build an at-scale gene therapy manufacturing process and corresponding analytics sufficient to meet the needs of the Duchenne population with what we believe will be a potentially life-changing therapy. Armed with these data, we will seek a meeting with the FDA with the goal of rapidly starting our registrational study.” In the open-label study, 20 participants between the ages of four and seven were treated with a single infusion of SRP-9001 at a dose of 1.33x1014 vg/kg. In muscle biopsies from the first 11 patients taken 12 weeks after treatment, the following results were observed: All patients demonstrated robust transduction, with mean micro-dystrophin expression of 55.4% of normal, as measured by western blot.Muscle dystrophin levels demonstrated a mean of 70.5% (baseline 12.8%) muscle fibers expressing micro-dystrophin at 12 weeks with a mean intensity at the sarcolemma of 116.9% (baseline 41.0%) compared to normal biopsies, as measured by immunofluorescence. Comparisons between baseline and post-treatment measures were statistically significant (p=0.001 for positive fibers, and p=0.002 for intensity).Mean vector genome copies per nucleus reached 3.87. The safety profile of SRP-9001 observed in the first 11 participants in ENDEAVOR is consistent with the safety seen in earlier studies using clinical manufacturing process material. In line with previously reported clinical data, no clinically relevant complement activation was observed in these 11 patients. Two patients experienced serious adverse events (transaminase elevation in one patient and nausea and vomiting in a second patient) that fully resolved. About SRP-9001-103 (ENDEAVOR) Study SRP-9001-103 (Study 103) is an open-label clinical trial of SRP-9001 that has enrolled 20 participants with Duchenne muscular dystrophy between the ages of 4-7. Study 103 uses commercially representative SRP-9001 and the primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the quantity of micro-dystrophin protein expression measured by western blot at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures include change from baseline in micro-dystrophin expression fiber intensity as measured by immunofluorescence (IF) and micro-dystrophin expression measured by IF percent dystrophin positive fibers at 12 weeks. Exploratory endpoints include the change in vector genome copies per nucleus, North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) and certain timed functional tests. Including the initial 12-week period, patients will be followed for a total of five years. About SRP-9001 (rAAVrh74.MHCK7.micro-dystrophin) SRP-9001 is an investigational gene transfer therapy intended to deliver the micro-dystrophin-encoding gene to muscle tissue for the targeted production of the micro-dystrophin protein. Sarepta is responsible for global development and manufacturing for SRP-9001 and plans to commercialize SRP-9001 in the United States upon receiving FDA approval. In December 2019, Roche partnered with Sarepta to combine Roche’s global reach, commercial presence and regulatory expertise with Sarepta’s gene therapy candidate for Duchenne to accelerate access to SRP-9001 for patients outside the United States. Sarepta has exclusive rights to the micro-dystrophin gene therapy program initially developed at the Abigail Wexner Research Institute at Nationwide Children’s Hospital. About Duchenne Muscular DystrophyDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a rare, fatal neuromuscular genetic disease that occurs in approximately one in every 3,500-5,000 males worldwide. DMD is caused by a change or mutation in the gene that encodes instructions for dystrophin. Symptoms of DMD usually appear in infants and toddlers. Affected children may experience developmental delays such as difficulty in walking, climbing stairs or standing from a sitting position. As the disease progresses, muscle weakness in the lower limbs spreads to the arms and other areas. Most patients require full-time use of a wheelchair in their early teens, and then progressively lose the ability to independently perform activities of daily living such as using the restroom, bathing and feeding. Eventually, increasing difficulty in breathing due to respiratory muscle dysfunction requires ventilation support, and cardiac dysfunction can lead to heart failure. The condition is universally fatal, and patients usually succumb to the disease in their twenties.

Net product sales for the first quarter 2021 of $124.9 million, a 24% increase over the same quarter of prior year CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 05, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2021. “In the first quarter, we obtained FDA approval for and launched our third RNA therapy for Duchenne, AMONDYS 45™ (casimersen). The first AMONDYS 45 patient was treated within the first week of approval. Serving the community with EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, and AMONDYS 45, we achieved net product revenue of $124.9 million, a 24% increase over the same quarter in 2020,” stated Doug Ingram, Sarepta’s president and CEO. “We also made significant strides in the advancement of our pipeline. Two days ago we announced positive results for the 30 mg/kg cohort of SRP-5051, our lead PPMO candidate. As we reported, after a median of only 12-weeks and three doses, the PPMO showed a significant dose-dependent increase in expression, exhibiting an 18 times greater level of exon skipping and nearly an order of magnitude greater level of dystrophin production as compared to EXONDYS 51, the currently approved standard of care for those with Duchenne amenable to exon 51 skipping. SRP-5051 achieved this in about half the time as EXONDYS 51 and with only about 12% of the dose exposure.” Mr. Ingram continued, “Also in the first quarter we reported positive data from our ongoing study of SRP-9003, our investigational gene therapy for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2E at the 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference, reporting robust expression, a good safety profile, good durability to two years, and significantly better functional results than age-matched natural history. For SRP-9001, our investigational gene therapy for Duchenne, we have gained invaluable and proprietary insight from the read out of Part 1 of Study 102 which we have used to refine the protocol of our next trial, Study 301. We remain on track to report data in the second quarter from Study 103 (ENDEAVOR), our open-label study evaluating the performance of our commercially representative SRP-9001 material.” First Quarter 2021 and Recent Corporate Developments: Reported positive clinical results from Phase 2 MOMENTUM study of SRP-5051 in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to skipping exon 51: These results were from the 30 mg/kg arm of Part A of the MOMENTUM study (Study 5051-201), a global, Phase 2, multi-ascending dose clinical trial of SRP-5051, Sarepta’s next-generation peptide phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to skipping exon 51. Strong, dose-dependent exon-skipping and dystrophin expression results with monthly dosing of SRP-5051 were observed in ambulant and non-ambulant Duchenne patients when compared to earlier dosing cohorts in Part A and a control group who received weekly dosing of eteplirsen. Hypomagnesemia was identified in patients taking SRP-5051. Cases have resolved with oral magnesium supplementation and an analysis of all available data indicate that the hypomagnesemia is monitorable and manageable. Part A of MOMENTUM is now complete, and the Company is engaging regulatory agencies to outline next steps for the program. Part B of MOMENTUM is intended to be a pivotal trial supporting an accelerated approval in the United States. The full results will be presented at a future medical meeting. Results from the 30 mg/kg dose cohort: In biopsies taken at week 12, 30 mg/kg of SRP-5051 dosed monthly resulted in mean exon skipping of 10.79% (n=4). Exon skipping was measured by digital drop polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). This correlates to a >4x increase in exon skipping compared to the 20 mg/kg cohort of SRP-5051 at 12 weeks (mean exon skipping of 2.57%, n=2) and an 18x increase in exon skipping compared a weekly 30 mg/kg dose of eteplirsen at 24 weeks (mean exon skipping of 0.59%, n=16). At week 12, 30 mg/kg of SRP-5051 resulted in mean dystrophin production of 6.55% of normal. Dystrophin expression was measured by western blot. This is twice the dystrophin expression compared to the 20 mg/kg cohort at week 12 (mean expression of 3.06%) and eight times that of the eteplirsen comparison group (mean expression of 0.82%). Sarepta’s investigational gene therapy, SRP-9003 being developed for the treatment of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2E (LGMD2E/R4), showed sustained expression and functional improvements at two years after administration: At the 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference held in March, the Company presented the first expression data from biopsies of participants in Cohort 1 (low-dose cohort) taken two years after a single administration of SRP-9003. The results showed sustained protein expression in muscle tissue. In functional outcomes assessments taken two years following treatment in Cohort 1 and one year after treatment in Cohort 2 (high-dose cohort), patients continued to demonstrate stability in their NSAD (North Star Assessment for Dysferlinopathies) total score and improvements on timed function tests. The results from both cohorts reinforce the safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9003. Cohort 1 (Dosed at 1.85×1013 vg/kg), 24 months following treatment: As measured by western blot, mean beta-SG of 54% at 24 months of normal control, compared to 36% measured at Day 60.Percent immunofluorescent (IF) positive fibers was 48% compared to normal control, compared to 51% at Day 60.Participants showed a mean intensity of 35% of transduced beta-SG, properly localized to the muscle sarcolemma, as measured by IF, compared to 47% at Day 60.The mean NSAD improvement from baseline of 5.7 points at 18 months was sustained through 24 months.All three participants demonstrated continued improvements from baseline across all functional measures, including time-to-rise, four-stair climb, 100-meter walk test and 10-meter walk test. Cohort 2 (Dosed at 7.41×1013 vg/kg), 12 months following treatment: At Day 60, the expression of beta-SG (72% mean positive fibers and 73% mean intensity) resulted in increased expression of delta-sarcoglycan, with 65% mean positive fibers and 103% intensity, and gamma-sarcoglycan, 60% mean positive fibers and 97% intensity. These results suggest treatment with SRP-9003 demonstrates reconstitution of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, which could lead to improved membrane integrity and thus improved clinical motor outcomes measures.All three participants demonstrated improvements from baseline across all functional measures, including the NSAD, time-to-rise, four-stair climb, 100-meter walk test and 10-meter walk test.The mean NSAD improvement from baseline was 4.0 points at one year, compared to 3.7 at 6 months. Presented results from gene therapy and RNA platforms at the 2021 MDA Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference: Sarepta held two symposia and presented four podium presentations and six posters at MDA. In addition to the new two- and one-year data for SRP-9003, the three other podium presentations covered data from Part 1 of Study 9001-102, an ongoing clinical trial of SRP-9001, Sarepta’s investigational gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and pre-clinical approaches to the challenge of pre-existing antibodies. An analysis of time to loss of ambulation in patients taking eteplirsen compared to standard of care was also presented.

Financial ResultsOn a GAAP basis, the Company reported a net loss of $167.3 million and $17.5 million, or $2.10 and $0.23 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss for the first quarter of 2021 was $122.5 million, or $1.54 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $79.8 million, or $1.04 per basic and diluted share for the same period of 2020. Revenues For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded net product revenues of $124.9 million, compared to net product revenues of $100.4 million for the same period of 2020, an increase of $24.5 million. The increase primarily reflects the continuing increase in demand for the Company’s products in the U.S. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $22.0 million and $13.2 million of collaboration revenue, respectively, which relates to the Company’s collaboration arrangement with Roche Holding A.G. (Roche). Cost and Operating Expenses Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights)For the three months ended March 31, 2021, cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) was $22.3 million, compared to $12.6 million for the same period of 2020, an increase of $9.7 million. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to increasing demand for the Company’s products and the write-offs of certain batches of EXONDYS 51 not meeting the Company’s quality specifications for the three months ended March 31, 2021,",), {'client': <expertai.nlapi.cloud.client.ExpertAiClient object at 0x7f46556c07c0>})  took 1469825702 ns.

Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX) have confirmed a $200 million investment in a new high-tech manufacturing facility in Spain. Construction of the new plant in Zaragoza will begin later in the year. Upon completion, the company will have four plants in the country. Covering 86,000 square feet, the high-tech facility will initially house 150 personnel. There are plans to expand it to 323,000 square feet, consequently creating 600 jobs by 2030. The facility will be constructed according to sustainability and eco-efficiency standards. Intelligent and autonomous technologies will be integrated into the high-tech manufacturing facility. The facility will be used to produce drug-delivery devices as Becton Dickinson looks to strengthen its prospects in the high-growth pre-filled syringe business. Drug delivery devices produced in the facility will be sold to pharmaceutical companies in the European Union. "This new plant will also add needed capacity to support major vaccination campaigns, such as the one currently taking place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Eric Borin, BD Pharmaceutical System’s Worldwide President. The upcoming manufacturing facility is part of BD\'s $1.2 billion 4-year investment plan which was announced last year. The medical technology company is in the process of following its plan on upgrading its manufacturing capacity and technology of pre-filled syringes and drug delivery devices. (See Becton Dickinson stock analysis on TipRanks) Leerink Partners analyst Richard Newitter has reiterated a Hold rating on the stock. According to the analyst, there are other large-cap offerings with greater upward estimate revision and better stock upside potential. Newitter stated, “There was a lot to unpack this quarter, not to mention a surprise Diabetes spin-off announcement, but ultimately we think the main reason the stock came under pressure was due to FY22 EPS uncertainty.” The analyst has cut the price target to $260 from $270, implying 7.36% upside potential to current levels. Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 3 Buy and 2 Hold ratings. The average analyst price target of $271.25 implies 12% upside potential to current levels. BDX scores a 5 out of 10 on TipRanks’ Smart Score rating system, implying its performance is likely to align with market averages.

While there is starting to be some recovery in certain geographies, there continues to be a negative impact on our operations and financial results.

Sales Analysis Compared to 2020 and 2019 Consolidated net sales of $4.0 billion increased 10.2% in the quarter and 8.0% in constant currency from 2020. Organic net sales increased 1.8% in the quarter including 2.7% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.9% from lower prices.

Organic net sales increased 12.8% in the quarter including 13.4% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.6% from lower prices. Earnings Analysis Compared to 2020 Reported net earnings of $302 million decreased 38.7% in the quarter. Reported net earnings per diluted share of $0.79 decreased 39.2% in the quarter. Reported gross profit margin and reported operating income margin were 63.5% and 11.6% in the quarter. Reported net earnings include certain items, such as charges for acquisition and integration-related activities, the amortization of purchased intangible assets, restructuring-related and other charges, costs to comply with certain medical device regulations, recall-related matters, regulatory and legal matters and tax matters. Excluding the aforementioned items, adjusted gross profit margin(1) was 65.4% in the quarter, and adjusted operating income margin(1) was 23.5% in the quarter, a decline of 50 basis points. Adjusted net earnings(1) of $737 million increased 5.4% in the quarter. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share(1) of $1.93 increased 4.9% in the quarter. 2021 Outlook We continue to monitor and evaluate the impact the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will continue to have, on our operations and financial results. As we recover from the pandemic, we continue to expect 2021 organic net sales growth to be in the range of 8% to 10% from 2019, as this is a more normal baseline given the variability throughout 2020, and now expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share(2) to be in the range of $9.05 to $9.30, including the full year impact of the acquisition of Wright Medical. Consistent with the pricing environment experienced in both 2019 and 2020, we expect continued unfavorable price reductions of approximately 1% in 2021. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect EPS will be positively impacted by $0.05 to $0.10 for the full year. This guidance assumes an ongoing recovery in our key geographies leading to more normalized elective procedure levels during the second quarter of 2021. As previously announced, we will not be providing quarterly guidance. (1) A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin, adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per diluted share, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures: gross profit margin, operating income and operating income margin, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, and other important information accompanies this press release. (2) We are unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of our expected net earnings per diluted share to expected adjusted net earnings per diluted share as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable effort the impact and timing of restructuring-related and other charges, acquisition-related expenses and fair value adjustments to inventory and the outcome of certain regulatory, legal and tax matters. The financial impact of these items is uncertain and is dependent on various factors, including timing, and could be material to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

(NASDAQ: FATE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for cancer, today announced encouraging interim Phase 1 data from the Company’s off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived natural killer (NK) cell programs in relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation study of FT516 as monotherapy is currently enrolling patients in the third dose cohort (900 million cells per dose), with three patients treated in the first dose cohort (90 million cells per dose) and six patients treated in the second dose cohort (300 million cells per dose). The Phase 1 dose-escalation study of FT538 as monotherapy is currently ongoing, with three patients treated in the first dose cohort (100 million cells per dose). As of the data cutoff date of April 16, 2021, five of 12 patients had achieved an objective response with complete leukemic blast clearance in the bone marrow (FT516 [n=9]: 3 complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery [CRi], 1 morphologic leukemia-free state [MLFS]; FT538 [n=3]: 1 CRi). Of the four patients achieving a CRi, one patient successfully proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplant and the other three patients remained on-study and in remission without further therapeutic intervention, two of whom remained in remission having been on-study for more than six months. Clinical assessments were based on the 2017 European LeukemiaNet (ELN) response criteria (Blood (2017) 129 (4): 424–447). Importantly, no dose-limiting toxicities, and no cases of any grade of cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or graft-versus-host disease, were observed. Patients had received a median of three prior lines of therapy, with 11 of 12 patients refractory to their last prior therapy. At baseline prior to conditioning chemotherapy, 11 of 12 patients had significant hematopoietic impairment, with both neutrophil counts below 1,000/µL and platelet counts below 100,000/µL. “We are highly encouraged by these Phase 1 data in patients with relapsed / refractory AML, which clearly indicate that off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cells administered as monotherapy in the outpatient setting were well-tolerated, and have the potential to induce complete leukemic blast clearance in the bone marrow and confer durable remissions without further therapeutic intervention. Complete leukemic blast clearance in the bone marrow is essential as recent studies in relapsed / refractory AML have shown that this clinical outcome results in a statistically-significant improvement in patient survival,” said Scott Wolchko, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. “Additionally, we are excited that a patient receiving FT538 in the initial dose escalation cohort achieved a complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery, and that FT538 continued to be detected in the peripheral blood at Day 8 post-infusion. This suggests that the additional engineered functionality of FT538 can augment NK cell pharmacokinetics without the need for exogenous cytokine support during patient treatment.” FT516 Phase 1 StudyFT516 is an investigational, universal, off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal engineered master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line. The Phase 1 clinical trial in relapsed / refractory AML is assessing FT516 administered as monotherapy. Up to two cycles of treatment are administered, with each cycle consisting of three days of conditioning chemotherapy followed by three weekly doses of FT516, with IL-2 cytokine support after each FT516 dose. FT516 may be administered in the outpatient setting with no requirement for inpatient monitoring during the treatment period. Three patients in the first dose cohort of 90 million cells per dose and six patients in the second dose cohort of 300 million cells per dose were assessed for safety and activity (see Table 1). Of the nine patients, eight had adverse molecular risk based on the 2017 ELN risk category and eight patients were refractory to their last prior therapy. Patients had received a median of three prior lines of therapy. At baseline prior to conditioning chemotherapy, all nine patients were significantly cytopenic, with eight patients having neutrophil counts below 1,000/µL and nine patients having platelet counts below 100,000/µL, and the median bone marrow leukemic blast percentage was 39%. Safety DataNo dose-limiting toxicities, and no cases of any grade of cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or graft-versus-host disease, were observed. The multi-dose treatment schedule was well-tolerated with no treatment discontinuations due to adverse events. Three patients experienced Grade 3 febrile neutropenia, and no other FT516-related Grade 3 or greater adverse events were reported by investigators. In addition, no evidence of anti-product T- or B-cell mediated host-versus-product alloreactivity was detected, supporting the potential to safely administer up to six doses of FT516 in the outpatient setting without the need for patient matching. Activity DataSix of nine relapsed / refractory AML patients showed anti-leukemic activity as evidenced by on-treatment reduction in bone marrow blasts, with four patients achieving an objective response with complete clearance of leukemic blasts in the bone marrow. Three of these four responders achieved a best overall response of CRi based on 2017 ELN response criteria, including two patients in the second dose cohort (Table 1: Subjects 1006 and 1007), each of whom had ongoing remission without further therapeutic intervention at six months’ follow-up, and one patient in the first dose cohort (Table 1: Subject 1001) who successfully proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplant. FT538 Phase 1 StudyFT538 is an investigational, universal, off-the-shelf NK cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master iPSC line engineered with three functional components designed to enhance innate immunity. The Phase 1 clinical trial in relapsed / refractory AML is assessing FT538 administered as monotherapy. Up to two cycles of treatment are administered, with each cycle consisting of three days of conditioning chemotherapy followed by three weekly doses of FT538 without IL-2 cytokine support. FT538 may be administered in the outpatient setting with no requirement for inpatient monitoring during the treatment period. Three patients were enrolled in the first dose cohort of 100 million cells per dose, two of whom were evaluable for safety and anti-leukemic activity and one patient who discontinued from the study prior to completion of the first treatment cycle due to clinical evidence of failure to respond to therapy (see Table 2). Of the two evaluable patients, one patient had adverse molecular risk based on the 2017 ELN risk category. Both patients had received at least three prior lines of therapy, were refractory to their last prior therapy, and were significantly cytopenic with neutrophil counts below 1,000/µL and platelet counts below 100,000/µL at baseline prior to conditioning chemotherapy. Safety DataNo dose-limiting toxicities, and no cases of any grade of cytokine release syndrome, immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or graft-versus-host disease, were observed. The multi-dose treatment schedule was well-tolerated with no FT538-related Grade 3 or greater adverse events reported by investigators. In addition, no evidence of anti-product T- or B-cell mediated host-versus-product alloreactivity was detected, supporting the potential to safely administer up to six doses of FT538 in the outpatient setting without the need for patient matching. Activity DataBoth evaluable patients showed anti-leukemic activity as evidenced by on-treatment reduction in bone marrow blasts. One patient (Table 2: Subject 1003), who was refractory to their two most recent prior therapies (an investigational CD33-targeted tri-specific NK cell engager [TriKE], followed by glasdegib in combination with low-dose cytarabine), achieved a CRi based on 2017 ELN response criteria at the end of the first treatment cycle and remained on-study. FT538 was detected in the peripheral blood at Day 8 prior to administration of the second dose in both patients. Table 1.

(NASDAQ: FATE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of programmed cellular immunotherapies for patients with cancer, today reported business highlights and financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. “During the first quarter of 2021, we strengthened our balance sheet by raising $460 million and successfully positioned our off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived NK cell pipeline to achieve significant clinical milestones across our disease franchises throughout the remainder of the year. We look forward to sharing Phase 1 clinical data from our FT516 and FT538 programs in relapsed / refractory AML at an investor event to be held alongside the ASGCT conference. We are also pleased with the clinical expansion of our FT538 program into solid tumors, where we plan to combine with FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies targeting EGFR, HER2, and PDL1,” said Scott Wolchko, President and Chief Executive Officer of Fate Therapeutics. “While we are disappointed that the PROTECT study of ProTmune did not meet its primary endpoint for prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic stem cell transplant, we will now turn our full attention and resources to our deep pipeline of off-the-shelf, iPSC-derived cancer immunotherapies. We would like to sincerely thank the patients, caregivers and investigators who participated in the clinical investigation of ProTmune, and we intend to share our clinical findings with that community.” AML Disease Franchise Interim Phase 1 Clinical Data for FT516 and FT538 Programs to be Featured at Upcoming Investor Event. On May 13, the Company plans to host a virtual investor event to highlight interim Phase 1 clinical data from its FT516 (hnCD16 engineered iPSC-derived NK cell) and FT538 (hnCD16 + IL-15RF + CD38KO engineered iPSC-derived NK cell) programs for the treatment of relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The Phase 1 study of FT516 as a monotherapy (NCT04023071) has enrolled the first and second dose cohorts (90 million and 300 million cells per dose, respectively), and dose escalation is ongoing with enrollment in the third dose cohort (900 million cells per dose). The Phase 1 study of FT538 as a monotherapy (NCT04614636) is enrolling in the first dose cohort (100 million cells per dose). The Company is also working with investigators from the Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of FT538 in combination with the CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody daratumumab in patients with relapsed / refractory AML, a therapeutic strategy designed to exploit the product candidate’s proprietary high-affinity, non-cleavable (hnCD16) receptor and CD38 knock-out (CD38KO) to target and eliminate CD38+ leukemic blasts.ASGCT Symposium to Highlight Adaptive NK Cell Features and Functionality of FT538. At the 24th Annual American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Meeting (ASGCT) to be held virtually from May 11-14, Dr. Jeffrey S. Miller, Professor of Medicine, University of Minnesota and Deputy Director of the Masonic Cancer Center, plans to present preclinical data demonstrating that the metabolic, transcriptional and functional properties of FT538 are substantially similar to those of adaptive NK cells, a discrete subset of memory-like NK cells with superior effector function. First described as a well-defined subset of NK cells that expand in cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositive individuals (Gumá et al., 2004), adaptive NK cells exhibit increased effector function, enhanced persistence, resistance to oxidative stress, and potent serial cytotoxicity. Dr. Miller’s presentation is scheduled to be held on May 11 during a session entitled Recent Advances and Future Directions of Gene and Cellular Therapies in Immune Oncology. B-cell Malignancy Disease Franchise New FT516 Phase 1 Clinical Data for B-cell Lymphoma to be Presented at ASCO. Dose escalation is ongoing with enrollment in the fourth dose cohort (900 million cells per dose) in the Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT516 in combination with CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of relapsed / refractory B-cell lymphoma (BCL) (NCT04023071). The Company plans to present new clinical data from the Phase 1 study as part of a poster session at the 2021 American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting (ASCO) being held virtually from June 4-8. In December 2020, the Company reported positive interim data from the second and third dose cohorts (90 million and 300 million cells per dose, respectively), with three of four patients achieving an objective response including two complete responses.Submitted FT596 Protocol Amendment to FDA to Assess Multi-dose Treatment Schedule. The Phase 1 clinical trial of FT596 (CAR19 + hnCD16 + IL-15RF engineered iPSC-derived NK cell) is designed to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT596 as a monotherapy and in combination with CD20-targeted monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of relapsed / refractory BCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (NCT04245722). Dose escalation of the single-dose treatment schedule is ongoing with enrollment in the third dose cohort (300 million cells) as monotherapy and in combination with rituximab for the treatment of BCL, and in the first dose cohort (30 million cells) as a monotherapy for the treatment of CLL. The Company has submitted a protocol amendment to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to also assess administration of multi-dose treatment schedules for FT596.FT819 Product Attributes to be Featured in Oral Presentation at ASGCT. The Company is preparing to initiate a multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial of FT819, the first-ever off-the-shelf, allogeneic CAR T-cell therapy derived from a clonal master iPSC line, for patients with BCL, CLL, or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In an oral presentation at ASGCT, the Company plans to describe the generation of the clonal master engineered iPSC line for FT819 using its proprietary iPSC platform, and to present preclinical data of FT819 characterizing its phenotypic and functional profile, including its expression of memory, activation and exhaustion markers, and its anti-tumor activity in comparison to primary CAR T cells. FT819 is engineered with several first-of-kind features designed to improve the safety and efficacy of CAR T-cell therapy including a novel 1XX CAR signaling domain targeting CD19+ malignancies (1XX-CAR19) that extends T-cell effector function without eliciting exhaustion; integration of the CAR transgene directly into the T-cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) locus, which promotes uniform CAR expression and enhances T-cell potency; and complete bi-allelic disruption of T-cell receptor expression to prevent graft-versus-host disease. Multiple Myeloma Franchise Phase 1 Study for FT538 in Combination with Daratumumab Set for Initiation. The Phase 1 clinical trial is designed to assess three once-weekly doses of FT538 in combination with the CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody, daratumumab, for patients with relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma (NCT04614636). The Company will initiate enrollment at 100 million cells per dose upon clearance of the first dose cohort in the study’s AML regimen assessing FT538 as monotherapy.FT576 Preclinical Data Presented at AACR Demonstrate Super Anti-tumor Activity. At the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting 2021 (AACR) in April, the Company presented preclinical data for FT576 (CAR-BCMA + hnCD16 + IL-15RF + CD38KO engineered iPSC-derived NK cells), demonstrating superior in vivo persistence and anti-tumor activity as compared to cytokine-expanded primary NK cells in a disseminated xenograft model of multiple myeloma. In addition, the Company observed that multi-antigen targeting of FT576 in combination with daratumumab exhibits greater in vivo efficacy compared to primary CAR T cells in combination with a gamma secretase inhibitor. FT576 is derived from a clonal master iPSC line engineered with four functional components designed to enable multi-antigen targeting of myeloma cells, augment antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), promote NK cell activation without exogenous cytokine support, enhance cell persistence and prevent anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody-induced fratricide. The Company is preparing to initiate a multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial to assess single-dose and multi-dose treatment regimens of FT576 as monotherapy and in combination with CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of relapsed / refractory multiple myeloma. Solid Tumor Franchise IND Application Allowed by FDA for FT538 in Combination with Monoclonal Antibody Therapy for Solid Tumors. The Company plans to initiate a multi-center Phase 1 clinical trial to assess the safety and determine the maximum dose of FT538 in combination with monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of a broad array of solid tumors. The novel therapeutic strategy is designed to exploit the product candidate’s hnCD16 receptor to promote ADCC, a potent anti-tumor mechanism by which NK cells recognize, bind and kill antibody-coated cancer cells. The clinical protocol includes combination with three monoclonal antibodies: EGFR-targeted cetuximab; HER2-targeted trastuzumab; and PDL1-targeted avelumab.

Human iPSCs possess the unique dual properties of unlimited self-renewal and differentiation potential into all cell types of the body. The Company’s first-of-kind approach involves engineering human iPSCs in a one-time genetic modification event and selecting a single engineered iPSC for maintenance as a clonal master iPSC line. Analogous to master cell lines used to manufacture biopharmaceutical drug products such as monoclonal antibodies, clonal master iPSC lines are a renewable source for manufacturing cell therapy products which are well-defined and uniform in composition, can be mass produced at significant scale in a cost-effective manner, and can be delivered off-the-shelf for patient treatment. As a result, the Company’s platform is uniquely capable of overcoming numerous limitations associated with the production of cell therapies using patient- or donor-sourced cells, which is logistically complex and expensive and is subject to batch-to-batch and cell-to-cell variability that can affect clinical safety and efficacy. Fate Therapeutics’ iPSC product platform is supported by an intellectual property portfolio of over 350 issued patents and 150 pending patent applications. About FT516FT516 is an investigational, universal, off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line engineered to express a novel high-affinity 158V, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor, which has been modified to prevent its down-regulation and to enhance its binding to tumor-targeting antibodies. CD16 mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), a potent anti-tumor mechanism by which NK cells recognize, bind and kill antibody-coated cancer cells. ADCC is dependent on NK cells maintaining stable and effective expression of CD16, which has been shown to undergo considerable down-regulation in cancer patients. In addition, CD16 occurs in two variants, 158V or 158F, that elicit high or low binding affinity, respectively, to the Fc domain of IgG1 antibodies. Numerous clinical studies with FDA-approved tumor-targeting antibodies, including rituximab, trastuzumab and cetuximab, have demonstrated that patients homozygous for the 158V variant, which is present in only about 15% of patients, have improved clinical outcomes. FT516 is being investigated in a multi-dose Phase 1 clinical trial as a monotherapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia and in combination with CD20-targeted monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of advanced B-cell lymphoma (NCT04023071). Additionally, FT516 is being investigated in a multi-dose Phase 1 clinical trial in combination with avelumab for the treatment of advanced solid tumor resistant to anti-PDL1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy (NCT04551885). About FT538FT538 is an investigational, universal, off-the-shelf natural killer (NK) cell cancer immunotherapy derived from a clonal master induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line engineered with three functional components: a novel high-affinity 158V, non-cleavable CD16 (hnCD16) Fc receptor, which has been modified to prevent its down-regulation and to enhance its binding to tumor-targeting antibodies; an IL-15 receptor fusion (IL-15RF) that augments NK cell activity; and the deletion of the CD38 gene (CD38KO), which promotes persistence and function in high oxidative stress environments. FT538 is designed to enhance innate immunity in cancer patients, where endogenous NK cells are typically diminished in both number and function due to prior treatment regimens and tumor suppressive mechanisms. In preclinical studies, FT538 has shown superior NK cell effector function, as compared to peripheral blood NK cells, with the potential to confer significant anti-tumor activity to patients through multiple mechanisms of action. FT538 is being investigated in a multi-dose Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in combination with daratumumab, a CD38-targeted monoclonal antibody therapy, for the treatment of multiple myeloma (NCT04614636).

(NYSE: JELD) Lifshitz Law Firm, P.C. announces that on October 26, 2020, the Court issued an Order denying Defendants\' Motions to Dismiss a putative class action complaint. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Jeld-Wen stated that its products, including doors, compete against those of other manufacturers based on price, and described the market in which the Company sells its doors as "highly competitive." The Company also repeatedly attributed its strong margins and anticipated margin growth to legitimate business factors, such as "strategic pricing decisions" and an increased emphasis on "pricing optimization." The Complaint alleges that these and similar statements made by Defendants during the Class Period were false and misleading because Defendants knew that Jeld-Wen was engaged in a price-fixing conspiracy and that as a result of Defendants\' misrepresentations, shares of Jeld-Wen\'s common stock traded at artificially inflated prices throughout the Class Period.

function eai_api_call(('With Sales Expected To Rise, Vanda Pharmaceuticals Stock Could Surge. Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VNDA) is a US biopharma marketer and developer of treatments intended to address specific unmet medical needs. Currently, even stronger demand is expected for the company’s products, with the total addressable market for its flagship drug set to increase. That said, the recent share price performance implies that Wall Street doesn’t fully appreciate its potential, creating an opportunity to acquire a stake in an asset with good growth perspectives and an affordable valuation. From The Most Recent Quarter and Full Year Fourth quarter GAAP earnings were $0.15 per share, beating the consensus estimate by $0.01. Additionally, total revenues for the quarter were $67.65 million, reflecting an 11% increase year-over-year and exceeding projections by $3.65 million. For 2020, total revenues increased by 9% year-over-year to $248.2 million, driven by a 12% increase in net sales from Hetlioz and a 4% rise in net sales from Fanapt. Hetlioz and Fanapt oral tablets are two products that Vanda Pharmaceuticals markets in the US, Europe, and Israel. The first is used as a treatment for non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, while the second medication was designed to treat schizophrenia. Looking ahead to 2021, management guided for a 15% increase in total revenues, and cash on hand of $400 million, about 10% more than last year. This will be used to develop effective marketing and sales strategies, and to complete studies aiming to expand the range of indications for Hetlioz. Valuation The stock appears to be relatively inexpensive. Shares are currently changing hands for about $15.84 apiece, with it still trading below the 50- and 100-day simple moving average lines. Market Prospects Hetlioz is the company’s flagship product as it makes up 65% of the total revenue, with the total addressable market for the therapy only expected to grow. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder is a circadian rhythm disorder and occurs because a patient’s internal clock and the light and dark phases of day and night are not synchronized. People affected by a loss of vision often suffer from this disorder, as the inability to see light prevents specific nerve cells in the brain that regulate this internal clock from being stimulated. However, a strong rise in the frequency of the disorder is expected among people who have normal vision as more and more time is spent online during the late hours of the night. Wall Street’s Take In the last three months, one Buy rating and one Hold rating have been assigned by Wall Street analysts. So, Vanda Pharmaceuticals is a Moderate Buy. At $21.00, the average analyst price target indicates 33% upside potential. (See Vanda Pharmaceuticals stock analysis on TipRanks) Summary The 12% pullback over the last month might have concerned some investors, but at the same time, it has created an interesting opportunity to buy a stock that is likely going to deliver impressive returns.

RNAi therapeutics company Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc reported positive interim data from its ongoing Phase 1 study of ALN-AGT. The company is evaluating ALN-AGT for the treatment of hypertension. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) President of R&D, Akshay Vaishnaw, M.D., Ph.D., said, “We believe the results for ALN-AGT are highly encouraging and demonstrate the potential of an RNAi therapeutic to help people reach and maintain their blood pressure goals.” Vaishnaw added, “Based on these findings, we look forward to advancing the clinical program for ALN-AGT with the initiation of Phase 2 KARDIA studies planned in mid-2021.” (See Alnylam Pharmaceuticals stock analysis on TipRanks) This was a double-blind, placebo controlled study with a single ascending dose. It included 84 hypertension patients to study the safety, tolerability and preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic activity of the drug. The single doses achieved sustained reductions in Serum Angiotensinogen at 12 weeks, leading to lowered blood pressure and supporting the potential of once quarterly or biannual dosing in patients. ALN-AGT was observed to be generally well tolerated among subjects with an acceptable safety profile. This data supports advancing the therapy to Phase 2 studies. Last month, Chardan Capital analyst Keay Nakae reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a $190 price target (37.4% upside potential). Nakae commented, “Alnylam is the clear leader in the RNAi space, as its scale, experience, patents, and breadth of pipeline place it in an advantageous position.” The consensus on the Street is that Alnylam is a Moderate Buy, based on 8 Buys and 7 Holds.

Google comes into the strategic partnership with a cloud network covering 25 regions worldwide, ideal for lowering latency and ensuring Shopify is always available to merchants. Likewise, the company\'s Global Virtual Private Cloud will allow the e-commerce platform to deploy applications in multiple regions. (See Alphabet stock analysis on TipRanks).

(Nasdaq: APLS) and Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) (Sobi™) (STO:SOBI) today reported positive top-line results from the Phase 3 PRINCE study evaluating the efficacy and safety of EMPAVELI™ (pegcetacoplan) in adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) who are treatment naïve, meaning they had not received a complement inhibitor within three months before entering the study. EMPAVELI demonstrated statistical superiority on the co-primary endpoints of hemoglobin stabilization and reduction in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) compared to standard of care, which did not include complement inhibitors, at Week 26. 86% of EMPAVELI-treated patients achieved hemoglobin stabilization compared to 0% of patients on standard of care (p<0.0001). Hemoglobin stabilization was defined as an avoidance of a >1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions.Mean LDH in the EMPAVELI group decreased by 90% from a baseline of 2151 U/L [9.5x upper limit of normal (ULN)] to 211 U/L, which is within the normal range, compared to a 14% reduction on standard of care from a baseline of 1946 U/L (8.6x ULN) to 1681 U/L (7.4x ULN) (p<0.0001). “The positive PRINCE data showed that EMPAVELI provided clinically meaningful improvements across multiple measures that are important for patients and build on our recent FDA approval of EMPAVELI in PNH,” said Federico Grossi, M.D., Ph.D., chief medical officer, Apellis. “Combined with previous studies, these results emphasize the potential of EMPAVELI to provide disease control for all adults with PNH regardless of prior treatment.” EMPAVELI also achieved statistical superiority on several secondary endpoints, including improvements in hemoglobin levels and transfusion avoidance, compared to standard of care, which did not include complement inhibitors. Mean hemoglobin levels in the EMPAVELI group increased from 9.4 g/dL to 12.1 g/dL compared to an increase from a baseline of 8.7 g/dL to 9.4 g/dL on standard of care (p=0.0019).91% of patients on EMPAVELI were transfusion free compared to 22% on standard of care (p<0.0001). The safety profile of EMPAVELI was consistent with previous studies. At Week 26, 9% of patients in the EMPAVELI group experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) compared to 17% on standard of care. One death was reported in each group, and neither were related to treatment. No cases of meningitis or thrombosis were reported in either group. The most common adverse events reported during the study in the EMPAVELI and standard of care groups, respectively, were injection site reaction (30% vs. 0%), hypokalemia (13% vs.11%), and fever (9% vs. 0%). “The PRINCE study results reinforce the efficacy and safety profile of EMPAVELI in PNH,” said Ravi Rao, head of research and development and chief medical officer at Sobi. “Our hope is to contribute to an improvement of care and to make a difference in the lives of people with this rare blood disease.” Detailed results from the PRINCE study will be presented at medical congresses. About the PRINCE StudyThe PRINCE study (NCT04085601) is a 2:1 (EMPAVELI: standard of care) randomized, multi-center, open-label, controlled Phase 3 study in 53 treatment-naïve adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The primary objective of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of EMPAVELI™ (pegcetacoplan) in patients who have not received treatment with any complement inhibitor within three months prior to screening. During the 26-week randomized, controlled period, patients received either 1080 mg of EMPAVELI twice weekly or standard of care therapy, which did not include complement inhibitors. Patients in the standard of care group had the option to escape to the EMPAVELI group if their hemoglobin decreased 2 g/dL or more from their baseline value. The study was conducted in collaboration with SFJ Pharmaceuticals, who supported the development of EMPAVELI in PNH. SFJ is a global drug development company, which provides a unique and highly customized co-development partnering model for the world’s top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. About EMPAVELI™ (pegcetacoplan)EMPAVELI™ (pegcetacoplan) is the first and only approved therapy targeting C3, the central protein in the complement cascade. EMPAVELI acts proximally in the complement cascade controlling both C3b-mediated extravascular hemolysis and terminal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. EMPAVELI is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). U.S. Important Safety Information for EMPAVELI BOXED WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS CAUSED BY ENCAPSULATED BACTERIA Meningococcal infections may occur in patients treated with EMPAVELI and may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Use of EMPAVELI may predispose individuals to serious infections, especially those caused by encapsulated bacteria, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W, Y, and B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B.Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for vaccinations against encapsulated bacteria.Vaccinate patients at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of EMPAVELI unless the risks of delaying therapy with EMPAVELI outweigh the risk of developing a serious infection.Vaccination reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of serious infections. Monitor patients for early signs of serious infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected.EMPAVELI is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the EMPAVELI REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program. CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity to pegcetacoplan or to any of the excipientsNot currently vaccinated against certain encapsulated bacteria, unless the risks of delaying EMPAVELI treatment outweigh the risks of developing a bacterial infection with an encapsulated organismUnresolved serious infection caused by encapsulated bacteria including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serious Infections Caused by Encapsulated BacteriaThe use of EMPAVELI may predispose individuals to serious, life-threatening, or fatal infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis types A, C, W, Y, and B, and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib). To reduce the risk of infection, all patients must be vaccinated against these bacteria according to the most current ACIP recommendations for patients with altered immunocompetence associated with complement deficiencies. Revaccinate patients in accordance with ACIP recommendations considering the duration of therapy with EMPAVELI. For patients without known history of vaccination, administer required vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of EMPAVELI. If immediate therapy with EMPAVELI is indicated, administer required vaccine as soon as possible and provide patients with 2 weeks of antibacterial drug prophylaxis. Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of serious infection and evaluate patients immediately if an infection is suspected. Promptly treat known infections. Serious infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. Consider discontinuation of EMPAVELI in patients who are undergoing treatment for serious infections. EMPAVELI REMSBecause of the risk of serious infections, EMPAVELI is available only through a restricted program under a REMS. Under the EMPAVELI REMS, prescribers must enroll in the program and must counsel patients about the risk of serious infection, provide the patients with the REMS educational materials, and ensure patients are vaccinated against encapsulated bacteria. Enrollment and additional information are available by telephone: 1-888-343-7073 or at www.empavelirems.com. Infusion-Related ReactionsSystemic hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., facial swelling, rash, urticaria) have occurred in patients treated with EMPAVELI. One patient (less than 1% in clinical studies) experienced a serious allergic reaction which resolved after treatment with antihistamines. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction (including anaphylaxis) occurs, discontinue EMPAVELI infusion immediately, institute appropriate treatment, per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms are resolved. Monitoring PNH Manifestations after Discontinuation of EMPAVELIAfter discontinuing treatment with EMPAVELI, closely monitor for signs and symptoms of hemolysis, identified by elevated LDH levels along with sudden decrease in PNH clone size or hemoglobin, or reappearance of symptoms such as fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, dyspnea, major adverse vascular events (including thrombosis), dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction. Monitor any patient who discontinues EMPAVELI for at least 8 weeks to detect hemolysis and other reactions.

(Nasdaq: APLS), a global biopharmaceutical company and leader in targeted C3 therapies, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved EMPAVELI™ (pegcetacoplan), the first and only targeted C3 therapy for treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). EMPAVELI is approved for use in adults with PNH who are treatment naïve as well as patients switching from the C5 inhibitors Soliris® (eculizumab) and Ultomiris® (ravulizumab). “EMPAVELI has the potential to improve the lives of patients with PNH by increasing hemoglobin and reducing blood transfusion requirements,” said Olga Frankfurt, M.D., PEGASUS study investigator and associate professor in the department of medicine, division of hematology and oncology, Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University. “Through my work as an investigator on the PEGASUS study, I was excited to see EMPAVELI providing broad control of PNH." “As the first, FDA-approved targeted C3 therapy, EMPAVELI has the potential to redefine treatment for adults with PNH, including patients switching from any C5 inhibitor and treatment-naïve patients. Thank you to the clinical trial participants, PNH community, investigators, healthcare professionals, SFJ Pharmaceuticals, and more who helped contribute to this significant milestone,” said Cedric Francois, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder and chief executive officer, Apellis. “This approval represents a major scientific advancement as EMPAVELI ushers in the first new class of complement medicine in almost 15 years. We look forward to exploring the full potential of targeting C3 and continue to advance registrational programs of this therapy across multiple complement-driven diseases with high unmet need.” The approval of EMPAVELI is based on results from the head-to-head Phase 3 PEGASUS study, which were recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine. In the PEGASUS study, EMPAVELI met the primary endpoint, demonstrating superiority to Soliris for the change from baseline in hemoglobin level at Week 16 with an adjusted mean increase of 3.84 g/dL of hemoglobin (p<0.0001). Additionally, EMPAVELI met non-inferiority compared to Soliris on the endpoint of transfusion avoidance. Eighty five percent of EMPAVELI-treated patients were transfusion free over 16 weeks versus 15% of Soliris-treated patients. “We are pleased to hear of the FDA’s decision to approve EMPAVELI, which is an important milestone for patients,” said Janice Frey-Angel, chief executive officer and executive director, Aplastic Anemia and MDS International Foundation (AAMDSIF). “Many PNH patients are seeking choices in their treatment, so the approval brings new promise for the PNH community.” The prescribing information for EMPAVELI contains a boxed warning. EMPAVELI may increase the risk of meningococcal and other serious infections caused by encapsulated bacteria that may become rapidly life threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early. A Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) has been approved by the FDA for EMPAVELI. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of serious infection, provide patients with the REMS educational materials, and ensure patients are vaccinated against encapsulated bacteria. The most common serious adverse reaction in patients treated with EMPAVELI was infections (5%). The most common adverse reactions (≥10%) with EMPAVELI were injection site reactions (39%), infections (29%), diarrhea (22%), abdominal pain (20%), respiratory tract infection (15%), viral infection (12%), and fatigue (12%). No cases of meningitis and no deaths were reported in patients treated with EMPAVELI. PNH is a rare, chronic, life-threatening blood disorder caused by an acquired mutation, which leads to uncontrolled complement activation and the destruction of red blood cells through intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. According to a retrospective and a cross-sectional study of patients treated with C5 inhibitors, at least 72% had persistently low hemoglobin1,2 and at least 36% required one or more transfusions a year.1 Apellis is committed to helping patients with treatment access and support. ApellisAssist™ is a program designed to provide comprehensive product support to EMPAVELI patients throughout their treatment journey. This program provides services and product resources including insurance support, education, training, as well as financial assistance for eligible patients.

About the PEGASUS StudyThe PEGASUS study (APL2-302; NCT03500549) is a multi-center, randomized, head-to-head Phase 3 study in 80 adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The primary objective of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of EMPAVELI™ (pegcetacoplan) compared to Soliris® (eculizumab). Participants must have been on Soliris (stable for at least three months) with a hemoglobin level of <10.5 g/dL at the screening visit. During the four-week run-in, patients were dosed with 1080 mg of EMPAVELI twice weekly (n=41) in addition to their current dose of Soliris. During the 16-week randomized, controlled period, patients were randomized to receive either 1080 mg of EMPAVELI twice weekly or their current dose of Soliris (n=39). All participants completing the randomized controlled period (n=77) opted to enter the open-label EMPAVELI treatment period. The study was conducted in collaboration with SFJ Pharmaceuticals, who supported the development of EMPAVELI in PNH. SFJ is a global drug development company, which provides a unique and highly customized co-development partnering model for the world’s top pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. About EMPAVELI™ (pegcetacoplan)EMPAVELI™ (pegcetacoplan) is the first and only approved therapy targeting C3, the central protein in the complement cascade. EMPAVELI acts proximally in the complement cascade controlling both C3b-mediated extravascular hemolysis and terminal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. EMPAVELI is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). U.S. Important Safety Information for EMPAVELI BOXED WARNING: SERIOUS INFECTIONS CAUSED BY ENCAPSULATED BACTERIA Meningococcal infections may occur in patients treated with EMPAVELI and may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early.

The primary objective of this study was to establish the efficacy and safety of pegcetacoplan compared to eculizumab. Participants must have been on eculizumab (stable for at least three months) with a hemoglobin level of <10.5 g/dL at the screening visit. During the four-week run-in, patients were dosed with 1080 mg of pegcetacoplan twice weekly (n=41) in addition to their current dose of eculizumab. During the 16-week randomized, controlled period, patients were randomized to receive either 1080 mg of pegcetacoplan twice weekly or their current dose of eculizumab (n=39). All participants completing the randomized controlled period entered the open-label pegcetacoplan treatment period. About Pegcetacoplan (APL-2) Pegcetacoplan is an investigational, targeted C3 therapy designed to regulate excessive activation of the complement cascade, part of the body’s immune system, which can lead to the onset and progression of many serious diseases. Pegcetacoplan is a synthetic cyclic peptide conjugated to a polyethylene glycol polymer that binds specifically to C3 and C3b. Pegcetacoplan is being evaluated in several clinical studies across hematology, ophthalmology, nephrology, and neurology. Marketing applications for pegcetacoplan for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has granted the application Priority Review designation, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Pegcetacoplan was granted Fast Track designation by the FDA for the treatment of geographic atrophy and received orphan drug designation for the treatment of C3G by the FDA and EMA.

(Nasdaq: APLS), a global biopharmaceutical company and leader in targeted C3 therapies, today announced its first quarter 2021 financial results and business highlights. “With a potential U.S. approval for pegcetacoplan just a couple of weeks away, we are at the beginning of a transformational year for Apellis. Our commercial team is prepared to successfully execute our first product launch and meet the needs of PNH patients,” said Cedric Francois, M.D., Ph.D., co-founder and chief executive officer of Apellis. “At the same time, we are focused on advancing registrational programs of pegcetacoplan across several debilitating rare diseases and delivering on our goal to become number one in the retina. Geographic atrophy is the most significant remaining unmet need in the retina, and we are excited to see top-line results from our Phase 3 studies of pegcetacoplan in GA in the third quarter of this year. “For more than a decade, our team has built the foundation for Apellis’ leadership in complement, and we look forward to seeing the results of those efforts come together this year for patients living with serious, complement-driven diseases,” Dr. Francois continued. First Quarter 2021 Business Highlights and Upcoming Milestones: Systemic Pegcetacoplan in Rare Disease In March 2021, Apellis and Sobi announced that the New England Journal of Medicine published results from the Phase 3 PEGASUS study. The data at 16 weeks showed that pegcetacoplan, an investigational targeted C3 therapy, demonstrated statistically superior increases in mean hemoglobin levels compared with the C5 inhibitor Soliris® (eculizumab) and provided substantial improvements in other key markers of disease in adults with PNH who had persistent anemia following treatment with Soliris.Marketing applications for pegcetacoplan for the treatment of PNH are under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The New Drug Application was granted Priority Review by the FDA with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of May 14, 2021. The Marketing Authorization Application has the potential for a European Commission decision in the second half of 2021.In the second quarter of 2021, Apellis and Sobi expect to report top-line results from the Phase 3 PRINCE study in PNH patients who are treatment naïve.In the second half of 2021, Apellis expects to initiate a Phase 3 study in immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), and Sobi plans to initiate a Phase 3 study in cold agglutinin disease (CAD) and a potentially registrational Phase 2 study in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (HSCT-TMA). Intravitreal Pegcetacoplan in Ophthalmology In April 2021, Apellis announced 24-month data from the Phase 1b study of intravitreal pegcetacoplan in patients with advanced geographic atrophy (GA) and low vision. Data from a post hoc analysis demonstrated a 46% decrease in the growth rate of GA lesions in the treated eye compared to the untreated eye in eight patients with bilateral GA (disease in both eyes) at 24 months (p=0.007).In March 2021, Apellis announced that two leading journals, Ophthalmology and the American Journal of Ophthalmology, published post hoc analyses from the Phase 2 FILLY study of intravitreal pegcetacoplan for GA secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The published data underscore the potential of pegcetacoplan for GA.The company expects to announce top-line results from the Phase 3 DERBY and OAKS studies in the third quarter of 2021. APL-9 in COVID-19 In March 2021, Apellis announced that the company will not pursue additional development of APL-9, an investigational targeted C3 therapy designed for acute interventions, for the treatment of severe COVID-19. The decision followed an interim review of mortality data from the Phase 1/2 study by an independent data monitoring committee (DMC), which found no meaningful reduction in the overall mortality rate in patients treated with APL-9 in combination with standard of care therapy compared to standard of care alone. No safety signals were observed by the DMC. Pipeline Expansion Apellis plans to advance three new product candidates into clinical development by the end of 2022. First Quarter 2021 Financial Results: As of March 31, 2021, Apellis had $723.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities, compared to $646.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities as of March 31, 2020. This increase primarily reflects the addition of cash from the company’s convertible offering for gross proceeds of $328.9 million in May 2020, the receipt of $250.0 million in the upfront proceeds for the Sobi transaction in October 2020, and an additional $25.0 million receipt from Sobi in January 2021 less cash used in operations. Apellis reported a net loss of $183.7 million for the first quarter of 2021, compared to a net loss of $168.8 million for the same period in 2020. Research and development expenses were $84.0 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $69.3 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in R&D expense for first quarter 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in clinical trial costs associated with the ongoing Phase 3 trials and the preparation and commencement of our clinical trials in other indications, personnel-related costs primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel, and increased quality and medical affairs expenses. We expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase as the number of patients in our trials increases and the number of ongoing trials increases. General and administrative expenses were $40.6 million in the first quarter of 2021, compared to $29.5 million for the same period in 2020. The increase in general and administrative expenses for the first quarter 2021 was primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related costs, professional and consulting fees, general commercial preparation activities, director stock compensation expense, and insurance.

About Pegcetacoplan Pegcetacoplan is an investigational, targeted C3 therapy designed to regulate excessive activation of the complement cascade, part of the body’s immune system, which can lead to the onset and progression of many serious diseases. Pegcetacoplan is a synthetic cyclic peptide conjugated to a polyethylene glycol polymer that binds specifically to C3 and C3b. Pegcetacoplan is being evaluated in several clinical studies across hematology, ophthalmology, nephrology, and neurology. Marketing applications for pegcetacoplan for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) are under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has granted the application Priority Review designation, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Pegcetacoplan was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of geographic atrophy and received orphan drug designation for the treatment of C3 glomerulopathy by the FDA and EMA. For additional information regarding pegcetacoplan clinical trials, visit https://apellis.com/our-science/clinical-trials. About APL-9APL-9 is an investigational, targeted C3 therapy designed to control the complement cascade centrally and may have the potential to treat a range of diseases caused by excessive activation of complement. APL-9 leverages the same mechanism of action as Apellis’ lead compound, pegcetacoplan, but has a lower molecular weight and shorter half-life. APL-9 is designed to be intravenously administered for acute use. About ApellisApellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a global biopharmaceutical company that is committed to leveraging courageous science, creativity, and compassion to deliver life-changing therapies. Leaders in targeted C3 therapies, we aim to develop transformative therapies for a broad range of debilitating diseases that are driven by excessive activation of the complement cascade, including those within hematology, ophthalmology, nephrology, and neurology.

FIRST QUARTER 2021 FINANCIAL RESULTS Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: R&D expenses for continuing operations were $57.7 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $55.4 million for the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase in R&D was driven primarily by start-up costs associated with the Phase 3 studies of mitapivat in thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: SG&A expenses for continuing operations were $33.6 million for the first quarter of 2021 compared to $31.7 million for the first quarter of 2020. The year-over-year increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to one-time workforce expense. Discontinued Operations: Due to the sale of the oncology business during the first quarter of 2021, we have reclassified the results of the oncology business as discontinued operations, including total revenue of $41.4 million, TIBSOVO® net sales of $37 million, and operating expenses of $50.2 million related to discontinued operations. Net Income: Net income was $1.9 billion for the first quarter of 2021 compared to a net loss of $40.3 million for the first quarter of 2020.

Agios Receives $1.8 Billion in Upfront Cash to Focus on Accelerating and Expanding its Genetically Defined Disease Portfolio Agios Enters Into Agreement to Repurchase Approximately 10% of Its Outstanding Shares from Bristol-Myers Squibb for $344.5 Million CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGIO), a leader in the field of cellular metabolism to treat genetically defined diseases, today announced the closing of the sale of its commercial, clinical and research-stage oncology portfolio to Servier Pharmaceuticals, LLC, an independent global pharmaceutical company. The transaction was approved by Agios shareholders on March 25, 2021. In consideration for its oncology portfolio, Agios received from Servier $1.8 billion in upfront cash and is eligible to receive an additional $200 million in a potential future milestone payment for vorasidenib, as well as 5% royalties on U.S. net sales of TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib tablets) from sales after the closing through loss of exclusivity and 15% royalties on U.S. net sales of vorasidenib from the first commercial sale through loss of exclusivity. “First, I want to thank each and every employee within the oncology franchise who helped create truly meaningful, differentiated therapies for patients over the past decade. With your expertise and Servier's deep commitment to its expanding oncology portfolio, we look forward to watching these programs flourish,” said Jackie Fouse, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Agios. “As we look ahead, Agios is poised for a bright and focused future as we seek to rapidly advance our genetically defined disease portfolio, delivering sustainable, long-term value to shareholders and superior outcomes for patients. In the near-term, mitapivat has the potential to be a blockbuster product with approvals in our three initial focus areas – pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, thalassemia and sickle cell disease – and we have tremendous untapped potential for both the pyruvate kinase R (PKR) activation portfolio as well as our other preclinical assets.” In addition, Agios today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) to repurchase 7,121,658 shares of Agios common stock held by BMS and its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of $344.5 million, or $48.3785 per share, using the proceeds from the sale of the oncology business. As previously disclosed, the Agios board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $1.2 billion of its outstanding shares, using the proceeds from the sale of the oncology business. Following completion of the repurchase of shares from BMS, Agios expects to conduct the remaining $855.5 million of share repurchases over the next 12-18 months, including executing a meaningful portion of the planned repurchases by year-end through a combination of 10b5-1 plans and open market purchases. With a singular focus on growing the company’s genetically defined disease clinical and research pipeline, Agios anticipates significant key milestones in 2021, including filing for regulatory approval for mitapivat in adults with PK deficiency in both the U.S. and EU; initiating two Phase 3 studies of mitapivat in transfusion dependent and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia; initiating a Phase 2/3 study of mitapivat in sickle cell disease; presenting the first data from the healthy volunteer study of AG-946, the next generation PKR activator; and prioritizing new indications for PKR and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activator clinical development. In addition, Agios will explore all options to maximize the patient impact and value of mitapivat globally, including strategic transactions. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC acted as financial advisors to Agios on this transaction. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal advisor to Agios.

Regulated Information/Inside Information argenx Announces FDA Acceptance of BLA Filing for Efgartigimod for the Treatment of Generalized Myasthenia Gravis If approved, efgartigimod will be the first-and-only approval of an FcRn antagonistPrescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is December 17, 2021Pre-approval access program opened in U.S. for efgartigimod for eligible people living with gMG Breda, the Netherlands – March 2, 2021 – argenx (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX), a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases and cancers, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for intravenous (IV) efgartigimod, the company’s investigational FcRn antagonist and lead product candidate, for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). The FDA has set a standard 10-month review process with a PDUFA target action date of December 17, 2021. “This is an important milestone for argenx in our transition to a commercial-stage company and brings us closer to our mission to reach patients living with gMG, a debilitating neuromuscular disease,” said Tim Van Hauwermeiren, Chief Executive Officer of argenx. “We look forward to closely collaborating with the FDA through the BLA review process and to potentially making our first medicine available.” The BLA included results from the pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of efgartigimod for the treatment of patients with gMG. ADAPT met its primary endpoint defined as percentage of responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score among acetylcholine receptor-antibody positive (AChR-Ab+) gMG patients. 67.7% of AChR-Ab+ patients treated with efgartigimod achieved the primary endpoint compared with 29.7% on placebo (p<0.0001). Further, 40% of patients treated with efgartigimod achieved minimal symptom expression defined as MG-ADL scores of 0 (symptom free) or 1, compared to 11.1% of those who received placebo. The safety profile of efgartigimod was comparable to placebo. After completing ADAPT, 90% of participants entered ADAPT+, a three-year open-label extension study evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of efgartigimod. There are currently 118 patients still enrolled in ADAPT+. argenx also announced today the opening of its pre-approval access (PAA) program in the U.S., which will allow eligible people living with gMG to receive treatment with efgartigimod. The purpose of the PAA is to open availability of an investigational treatment to people who have a high degree of unmet clinical need with gMG and are not able to participate in a clinical trial. argenx is also on track to submit an application for efgartigimod to Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in the first half of 2021 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the second half of 2021. About Efgartigimod Efgartigimod is an investigational antibody fragment designed to reduce disease-causing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and block the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is widely expressed throughout the body and plays a central role in rescuing IgG antibodies from degradation. Blocking FcRn reduces IgG antibody levels representing a logical potential therapeutic approach for several autoimmune diseases known to be driven by disease-causing IgG antibodies, including: myasthenia gravis (MG), a chronic disease that causes muscle weakness; pemphigus vulgaris (PV), a chronic disease characterized by severe blistering of the skin; immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a chronic bruising and bleeding disease; and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), a neurological disease leading to impaired motor function. About Myasthenia Gravis Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease, often causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. More than 85% of people with MG progress to generalized MG (gMG) within 18 months, where muscles throughout the body may be affected, resulting in extreme fatigue and difficulties with facial expression, speech, swallowing and mobility. In more life-threatening cases, MG can affect the muscles responsible for breathing. There are approximately 65,000 people in the United States and 20,000 people in Japan living with the disease About argenx argenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases and cancer. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP), argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx is evaluating efgartigimod in multiple serious autoimmune diseases, and cusatuzumab in hematological cancers in collaboration with Janssen. argenx is also advancing several earlier stage experimental medicines within its therapeutic franchises. argenx has offices in Belgium, the United States, and Japan.

Net product sales for the first quarter 2021 of $124.9 million, a 24% increase over the same quarter of prior year CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 05, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT), the leader in precision genetic medicine for rare diseases, today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2021. “In the first quarter, we obtained FDA approval for and launched our third RNA therapy for Duchenne, AMONDYS 45™ (casimersen). The first AMONDYS 45 patient was treated within the first week of approval. Serving the community with EXONDYS 51, VYONDYS 53, and AMONDYS 45, we achieved net product revenue of $124.9 million, a 24% increase over the same quarter in 2020,” stated Doug Ingram, Sarepta’s president and CEO. “We also made significant strides in the advancement of our pipeline. Two days ago we announced positive results for the 30 mg/kg cohort of SRP-5051, our lead PPMO candidate. As we reported, after a median of only 12-weeks and three doses, the PPMO showed a significant dose-dependent increase in expression, exhibiting an 18 times greater level of exon skipping and nearly an order of magnitude greater level of dystrophin production as compared to EXONDYS 51, the currently approved standard of care for those with Duchenne amenable to exon 51 skipping. SRP-5051 achieved this in about half the time as EXONDYS 51 and with only about 12% of the dose exposure.” Mr. Ingram continued, “Also in the first quarter we reported positive data from our ongoing study of SRP-9003, our investigational gene therapy for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2E at the 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference, reporting robust expression, a good safety profile, good durability to two years, and significantly better functional results than age-matched natural history. For SRP-9001, our investigational gene therapy for Duchenne, we have gained invaluable and proprietary insight from the read out of Part 1 of Study 102 which we have used to refine the protocol of our next trial, Study 301. We remain on track to report data in the second quarter from Study 103 (ENDEAVOR), our open-label study evaluating the performance of our commercially representative SRP-9001 material.” First Quarter 2021 and Recent Corporate Developments: Reported positive clinical results from Phase 2 MOMENTUM study of SRP-5051 in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to skipping exon 51: These results were from the 30 mg/kg arm of Part A of the MOMENTUM study (Study 5051-201), a global, Phase 2, multi-ascending dose clinical trial of SRP-5051, Sarepta’s next-generation peptide phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PPMO) treatment for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy amenable to skipping exon 51. Strong, dose-dependent exon-skipping and dystrophin expression results with monthly dosing of SRP-5051 were observed in ambulant and non-ambulant Duchenne patients when compared to earlier dosing cohorts in Part A and a control group who received weekly dosing of eteplirsen. Hypomagnesemia was identified in patients taking SRP-5051. Cases have resolved with oral magnesium supplementation and an analysis of all available data indicate that the hypomagnesemia is monitorable and manageable. Part A of MOMENTUM is now complete, and the Company is engaging regulatory agencies to outline next steps for the program. Part B of MOMENTUM is intended to be a pivotal trial supporting an accelerated approval in the United States. The full results will be presented at a future medical meeting. Results from the 30 mg/kg dose cohort: In biopsies taken at week 12, 30 mg/kg of SRP-5051 dosed monthly resulted in mean exon skipping of 10.79% (n=4). Exon skipping was measured by digital drop polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR). This correlates to a >4x increase in exon skipping compared to the 20 mg/kg cohort of SRP-5051 at 12 weeks (mean exon skipping of 2.57%, n=2) and an 18x increase in exon skipping compared a weekly 30 mg/kg dose of eteplirsen at 24 weeks (mean exon skipping of 0.59%, n=16). At week 12, 30 mg/kg of SRP-5051 resulted in mean dystrophin production of 6.55% of normal. Dystrophin expression was measured by western blot. This is twice the dystrophin expression compared to the 20 mg/kg cohort at week 12 (mean expression of 3.06%) and eight times that of the eteplirsen comparison group (mean expression of 0.82%). Sarepta’s investigational gene therapy, SRP-9003 being developed for the treatment of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy Type 2E (LGMD2E/R4), showed sustained expression and functional improvements at two years after administration: At the 2021 Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference held in March, the Company presented the first expression data from biopsies of participants in Cohort 1 (low-dose cohort) taken two years after a single administration of SRP-9003. The results showed sustained protein expression in muscle tissue. In functional outcomes assessments taken two years following treatment in Cohort 1 and one year after treatment in Cohort 2 (high-dose cohort), patients continued to demonstrate stability in their NSAD (North Star Assessment for Dysferlinopathies) total score and improvements on timed function tests. The results from both cohorts reinforce the safety and tolerability profile of SRP-9003. Cohort 1 (Dosed at 1.85×1013 vg/kg), 24 months following treatment: As measured by western blot, mean beta-SG of 54% at 24 months of normal control, compared to 36% measured at Day 60.Percent immunofluorescent (IF) positive fibers was 48% compared to normal control, compared to 51% at Day 60.Participants showed a mean intensity of 35% of transduced beta-SG, properly localized to the muscle sarcolemma, as measured by IF, compared to 47% at Day 60.The mean NSAD improvement from baseline of 5.7 points at 18 months was sustained through 24 months.All three participants demonstrated continued improvements from baseline across all functional measures, including time-to-rise, four-stair climb, 100-meter walk test and 10-meter walk test. Cohort 2 (Dosed at 7.41×1013 vg/kg), 12 months following treatment: At Day 60, the expression of beta-SG (72% mean positive fibers and 73% mean intensity) resulted in increased expression of delta-sarcoglycan, with 65% mean positive fibers and 103% intensity, and gamma-sarcoglycan, 60% mean positive fibers and 97% intensity. These results suggest treatment with SRP-9003 demonstrates reconstitution of the dystrophin-associated protein complex, which could lead to improved membrane integrity and thus improved clinical motor outcomes measures.All three participants demonstrated improvements from baseline across all functional measures, including the NSAD, time-to-rise, four-stair climb, 100-meter walk test and 10-meter walk test.The mean NSAD improvement from baseline was 4.0 points at one year, compared to 3.7 at 6 months. Presented results from gene therapy and RNA platforms at the 2021 MDA Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference: Sarepta held two symposia and presented four podium presentations and six posters at MDA. In addition to the new two- and one-year data for SRP-9003, the three other podium presentations covered data from Part 1 of Study 9001-102, an ongoing clinical trial of SRP-9001, Sarepta’s investigational gene therapy for Duchenne muscular dystrophy and pre-clinical approaches to the challenge of pre-existing antibodies. An analysis of time to loss of ambulation in patients taking eteplirsen compared to standard of care was also presented.

Financial ResultsOn a GAAP basis, the Company reported a net loss of $167.3 million and $17.5 million, or $2.10 and $0.23 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, the net loss for the first quarter of 2021 was $122.5 million, or $1.54 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $79.8 million, or $1.04 per basic and diluted share for the same period of 2020. Revenues For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded net product revenues of $124.9 million, compared to net product revenues of $100.4 million for the same period of 2020, an increase of $24.5 million. The increase primarily reflects the continuing increase in demand for the Company’s products in the U.S. For the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized $22.0 million and $13.2 million of collaboration revenue, respectively, which relates to the Company’s collaboration arrangement with Roche Holding A.G. (Roche). Cost and Operating Expenses Cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights)For the three months ended March 31, 2021, cost of sales (excluding amortization of in-licensed rights) was $22.3 million, compared to $12.6 million for the same period of 2020, an increase of $9.7 million. The increase in cost of sales is primarily due to increasing demand for the Company’s products and the write-offs of certain batches of EXONDYS 51 not meeting the Company’s quality specifications for the three months ended March 31, 2021,".

Agios Receives $1.8 Billion in Upfront Cash to Focus on Accelerating and Expanding its Genetically Defined Disease Portfolio Agios Enters Into Agreement to Repurchase Approximately 10% of Its Outstanding Shares from Bristol-Myers Squibb for $344.5 Million CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 01, 2021 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AGIO), a leader in the field of cellular metabolism to treat genetically defined diseases, today announced the closing of the sale of its commercial, clinical and research-stage oncology portfolio to Servier Pharmaceuticals, LLC, an independent global pharmaceutical company. The transaction was approved by Agios shareholders on March 25, 2021. In consideration for its oncology portfolio, Agios received from Servier $1.8 billion in upfront cash and is eligible to receive an additional $200 million in a potential future milestone payment for vorasidenib, as well as 5% royalties on U.S. net sales of TIBSOVO® (ivosidenib tablets) from sales after the closing through loss of exclusivity and 15% royalties on U.S. net sales of vorasidenib from the first commercial sale through loss of exclusivity. “First, I want to thank each and every employee within the oncology franchise who helped create truly meaningful, differentiated therapies for patients over the past decade. With your expertise and Servier's deep commitment to its expanding oncology portfolio, we look forward to watching these programs flourish,” said Jackie Fouse, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Agios. “As we look ahead, Agios is poised for a bright and focused future as we seek to rapidly advance our genetically defined disease portfolio, delivering sustainable, long-term value to shareholders and superior outcomes for patients. In the near-term, mitapivat has the potential to be a blockbuster product with approvals in our three initial focus areas – pyruvate kinase (PK) deficiency, thalassemia and sickle cell disease – and we have tremendous untapped potential for both the pyruvate kinase R (PKR) activation portfolio as well as our other preclinical assets.” In addition, Agios today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) to repurchase 7,121,658 shares of Agios common stock held by BMS and its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of $344.5 million, or $48.3785 per share, using the proceeds from the sale of the oncology business. As previously disclosed, the Agios board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to $1.2 billion of its outstanding shares, using the proceeds from the sale of the oncology business. Following completion of the repurchase of shares from BMS, Agios expects to conduct the remaining $855.5 million of share repurchases over the next 12-18 months, including executing a meaningful portion of the planned repurchases by year-end through a combination of 10b5-1 plans and open market purchases. With a singular focus on growing the company’s genetically defined disease clinical and research pipeline, Agios anticipates significant key milestones in 2021, including filing for regulatory approval for mitapivat in adults with PK deficiency in both the U.S. and EU; initiating two Phase 3 studies of mitapivat in transfusion dependent and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia; initiating a Phase 2/3 study of mitapivat in sickle cell disease; presenting the first data from the healthy volunteer study of AG-946, the next generation PKR activator; and prioritizing new indications for PKR and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) activator clinical development. In addition, Agios will explore all options to maximize the patient impact and value of mitapivat globally, including strategic transactions. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC acted as financial advisors to Agios on this transaction. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acted as legal advisor to Agios. About AgiosAgios is focused on discovering and developing novel investigational medicines to treat genetically defined diseases through scientific leadership in the field of cellular metabolism.
